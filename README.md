# C++ Poker Simulator

## Overview

This C++ Poker Simulator is a console-based application designed to simulate a poker game. The application handles various aspects of poker gameplay, including card shuffling, dealing cards to players and a dealer, calculating winning probabilities, determining the winner of each round, and updating scores. The project is implemented in C++ and can be compiled and executed from the command line.

## Features

### 1. Card Shuffling

- The card pack is shuffled to ensure randomness in each round.
- A random number of shuffling operations are performed to enhance unpredictability.

### 2. Dealing Cards

- Players and the dealer each receive a set of five cards for each round.
- The card distribution is handled automatically by the simulator.

### 3. Winning Probabilities

- The simulator calculates winning probabilities based on the confidence levels of each player.
- Confidence levels are determined by the strength of the player's hand.

### 4. Round Winner

- At the end of each round, the winner is determined based on the calculated winning probabilities.
- Scores are updated for each player, and the round results are displayed.

### 5. Batch Execution

- A batch file (`run_poker_simulator.bat`) is provided for easy compilation and execution.
- Simply run the batch file to compile and execute the poker simulator.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the `poker_simulator.cpp` file.
   - Example command: `g++ poker_simulator.cpp -o poker_simulator`

2. **Execute the Compiled Program:**
   - Run the compiled executable.
   - Example command: `./poker_simulator` (on Unix-based systems) or `poker_simulator.exe` (on Windows).

3. **Batch Execution:**
   - Alternatively, execute the provided batch file:
     - On Unix-based systems: `./run_poker_simulator.bat`
     - On Windows: `run_poker_simulator.bat`

## File Structure

- `poker_simulator.cpp`: Contains the C++ code for the poker simulator.
- `run_poker_simulator.bat`: Batch file for easy compilation and execution.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes compiled files and other unnecessary files from version control.
